The primary participants in referral functions within the scope of the BSeR FHIR IG are the referral initiator, referral recipient, and referral patient. The resource profiles for the referral initiator and referral recipient use the FHIR R4 Practitioner and Practitioner Role as their base resources. The referral patient uses the US Core Patient profile as its base resource.
