The business states reflect a harmonization of the state machine required by BSeR and the state machined defined by the IHE Patient Care Coordination Technical Framework Supplement 360 Exchange Closed Loop Referral (360X). States reflected in the 360x state machine that relate to the interim states of in-progress service request fulfillment activities can be added as extended value sets for the BSeR IG and are reflected in the harmonized state machine.
