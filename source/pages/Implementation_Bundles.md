This specification defines two transactions types, a Referral Request Transaction and a Referral Feedback Transaction. Some resource profiles are common to both transaction types and others are transaction specific. Transaction specific profiles consist of program specific profiles and common non-program specific profiles. The Common Transaction Profiles provide information pertaining to the parties involved in the referral process: Referral Initiator, Referral Recipient, Patient, and Funding Source.

The table below illustrates how the transaction and program specific profiles are distributed across the six program areas covered in this iteration of the BSeR FHIR IG.
