### IG Development Guidance and Tooling

This guide was developed using tooling and professional guidance provided by [Lantana Consulting Group](https://www.lantanagroup.com/), the makers of [Trifolia-on-FHIR](https://trifolia-fhir.lantanagroup.com/)

The BSeR project team would like to acknowledge and express our sincere appreciation to the authors of the IHE Patient Care Coordination Technical Framework Supplement - 360 Exchange Closed Loop Referral (360X) [link](https://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/PCC/IHE_PCC_Suppl_360X.pdf). The referral state machine expressed in this specification draws heavily upon this work.

The BSeR project team would like to acknowledge and express our sincere appreciation to the HL7 Gravity social determinants of health (SDoH) [link](https://www.hl7.org/gravity/) project team for their assistance in defining ways in which the BSeR IG can be reused and extended to cover additional referral use cases - clinical and non-clinical.
