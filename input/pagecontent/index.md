### Note to Ballot Commenters

We are seeking specific feedback on the following issues:
 * Is it realistic for community-based organizations (CBOs) to offer secure subscriptions to data in their systems?
 * In the Notify of Referral step in [Referral - Notify and Pull](bi-directional_service_ereferral_transactions.html#referral-notify-and-pull) should both the Task and SerivceRequest be sent, or should just the Task be sent?

### Overview

The Bidirectional Services eReferral (BSeR) FHIR implementation guide (IG) provides guidance for using the HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard as an exchange format for clinical and non-clinical referrals (service requests). It is a collection of profiled FHIR resources designed for use in information exchanges supporting the placement of a service request by a referral initiating provider and the reporting of service delivery outcomes by a referral recipient provider. The goal of the BSeR project is to streamline and enhance the efficacy of the exchange of health information between health care systems and community services organizations involved in addressing chronic health conditions by establishing information exchange standards for electronic referrals and referral outcome reporting.
