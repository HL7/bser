# Resource Structure Definitions

This section of the BSeR FHIR Implementation Guide contains the structured definitons for each BSeR resource profile. 


Each structure definition contains the following elements:

* A definition of the resource profile
* A link to the profile's base resource specification
* A link to the profile's full detailed specification (on Simplifier.net)
* A structure definition table of the resource profile
* A UML expression of the resource profile
* A structure definition tree of the resource profile
