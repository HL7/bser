## BSeR FHIR Implementation Guide

The [BSeR FHIR Implementation Guide](https://simplifier.net/bidirectionalservice) was developed using Simplifier, a FHIR IG authoring tool from Firely. The entire guide is available for reviewed and downloaded from the Simplifier.net FHIR Registry.

## BSeR Domain Analysis Model

The workflow and information requirements for this IG are documented in a companion guide the [BSeR Domain Analysis Model](http://bit.ly/2KPlpHH-BSeRDAM) available for download from the documents page of the HL7 Public Health Workgroup.

## BSeR CDA Implementation Guide

A [BSeR CDA Implementation Guide](http://bit.ly/2MkST6d-BSeRCDAIG) was developed in parallel with this IG. The design of the BSeR CDA IG was driven by the same workflow and information requirements used to create this FHIR IG and documented in the BSeR DAM.
